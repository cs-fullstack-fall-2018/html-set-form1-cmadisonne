KEY: Where are my comments?! Please get in the habit of including at least one comment at the top of every submission saying what the code is doing. Can be brief, but needs to be there :-) 

KEY: Good job overall as this was a complicated exercise. Note comments inline. Missing the 'form' element and radio button grouping was really your only issues.

You are really doing a great job. You and Myiah are destroying the the Guys :-P
